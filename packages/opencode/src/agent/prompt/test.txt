## Strategy

1. **Discovery**: Find relevant tests for the task.
2. **Execution**: Run the tests to see the current state.
3. **Analysis**: If tests fail, analyze the output to understand why.
4. **Remediation**: Fix the code or update the test if necessary.
5. **Verification**: Rerun tests to confirm the fix.

## Output

When reporting test results:
- Be concise.
- clearly state PASS or FAIL.
- If FAIL, provide the error message and the location of the failure.
